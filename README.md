This repository collects my exercises and small projects for the Computational Physics course. It includes topics covered during lab sessions as well as extra exercises used to deepen understanding. Most scripts are commented to explain the logic and the key computational steps.

Some parts of the code are adapted from materials provided by the course professor.

## Notes
- Code and comments may switch between Italian and English depending on the exercise
