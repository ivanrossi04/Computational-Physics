## Derivatives with the Finite Difference Method

Date: **October 10, 2025**

We want to show the different accuracies of finite difference differentiation methods of order $\mathcal{O}(h)$, $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$, and $\mathcal{O}(h^4)$.
We will study the function $\sin(x)$, calculating the derivatives using finite differences and finding the error with respect to the function $\cos(x)$.

- First plot: error functions with a linear vertical scale.
- Second plot: absolute error with a logarithmic vertical scale.

_**Final note:** only represent the points where it was possible to calculate all the derivatives._
